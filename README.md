Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors. Knowing that all customers aren't the same, Instacart is considering a targeted marketing strategy. The goal is to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to increase sales of their products. 

 ## Objective
 The goal of this project as analyst is to uncover more information about sales patterns; perform intial data and exploratory analysis to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentations based on the data; and uncover specific customer profiles and their typical purchasing patterns. Key questions are: 
 - What are the busiest days of the week?
 - What are the busiest hours of the day?
 - What time period do customer spend the most money? 
 - What types are the most popular?
 - Which departments have the highest frequency of product orders?
 - Are there differences in ordering habits based on customer's loyalty status, region, or order frequency?
